# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository! Here, you will find my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented primarily in Python. I am currently focusing on solving the Blind 75 problems, a curated list of essential coding challenges frequently asked in technical interviews.

## üóÇ Repository Structure

The problems are categorized based on topic for easier navigation:

- **Array**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph**
- **Tree**
- **Miscellaneous**

Each solution file contains:

- A brief problem description
- The approach and algorithm used
- Time and space complexity analysis

## üìú Current Focus: Blind 75 Problems

This repository is a work in progress as I tackle the Blind 75 problems. These problems are known for their relevance in coding interviews and cover a range of fundamental topics. As I complete each problem, I will continue to update this repository.

## üöÄ How to Use

To view a solution, navigate to the relevant file in the repository. Each file is self-contained, with comments detailing the approach and complexity. You can also run each solution locally if you want to see the code in action.

### Running a Solution

To execute a solution, clone this repository and run the desired file using Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letyang23/leetcode.git
cd leetcode
python3 <filename>.py
```
